   TM4C123G Micro Distribution

About:

   A small distribution for the TI Tiva TM4C123G Launchpad device

Main features:

   * GCC Cortex-M4 toolchain
   * Hard floating point

Main builds:

   cortex-m4-sdk    - SDK with toolchain and TivaWare libs
   native/lm4flash  - Small utility to flash the device through ICDI

Build system requirements:

   We are not allowed to redistribute the TI TivaWare libraries. You must
   download the package yourself from http://www.ti.com/tool/sw-tm4c

   Place the SW-TM4C-xxx.exe file in buildfiles/cross/cross-ti-tm4c123g/tivaware

   Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 with the following additional
   packages installed:

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip groff bison flex gperf texinfo xsltproc \
                          libtool libncurses5-dev gawk libexpat1-dev \
                          gettext libglib2.0-dev intltool libusb-1.0-0-dev \
                          libxml2-utils docbook-xml cmake g++

   Also requires reconfiguring "/bin/sh" to use bash:

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

   Fact: Many software distributions fail to build using the dash shell.

Known issues:

   None
